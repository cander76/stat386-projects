# Introduction

One of the best parts of collecting and cleaning data is getting to learn from the data through creating visualizations. Not only can you learn from your own visualizations, but so can others (when the visualizations are well labeled).  Recently I performed a web scrape on a dataset from Rotten Tomatoes to see what the top movies of all time are (not limited to a certain genre). The link to my blog post in which I talk about the process of scraping and cleaning this particular dataset can be found [here](https://cander76.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/16/webscraping.html). I am a big fan of movies, so I was really curious to see how my idea of top movies ever align with Rotten Tomatoes. Not only that, I was hoping to see if certain genres, years, runtimes and more have a correlation to the ratings they are given.

# Factors that affect Star Rating

I was first interested in determining what different factors (if any) play into the difference in ratings among the movies. Because this is a list of the top movies of all time, the movies will all be highly rated. However, there is still some variability.

## 1. Movie Rating
The following plot shows the correlation between the Rating of the movie (G, PG, PG-13, R, Not Rated, and Passed) and the IMDB Star Rating:

From this plot, we see there is a lot of overlap among the different boxes, meaning there does not seem to be a significant difference among movie ratings. However, it is interesting to see the movies rated PG-13 are a bit lower than the others.

## 2. Runtime

The next plot shows the correlation between runtime of the movie and the IMDB star rating. It also still includes the different genres, which is shown through the different colors.

## 3. Year

I was also interested to see if the star ratings change over time, which can be shown in the plot below, where year is the x variable, and average rating is the y variable.

This plot shows that the ratings are still pretty consistent, but there is a slight decrease in the average ratings overtime. 

## 4. Genre

The final factor I was interested in determining if it affects Star Rating was Genre. The following bar plot shows the results for that:

# Factors that affect Runtime

I was then interested in determining what different factors (if any) play into the difference in runtime among the movies.

## 1. Genre

## 2. Movie Rating

# Conclusion

The point of this entire process is to be able to dive deep into data and see what we can learn from it. Overall, the ratings for the top 64 movies seem to be pretty similar, though some factors like genre and runtime seem to play a role in determining those ratings. In the end, the goal is to be able to tell a story of the data. Come again soon to read the "story" of this data.
