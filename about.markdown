# About Me
My name is Caitlyn Anderson, and I am a senior at Brigham Young University studying Applied Statistics and Analytics. I have always loved working with numbers and data, and it excites me that this blog allows me to write about them! I hope you find this blog insightful/interesting to read. Thanks for stopping by!
